fully functional e-commerce website using Python's Django framework, coupled with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The site features an array of essential e-commerce functionalities, such as the ability to add products to the cart, seamless payment processing via Razorpay, wishlist management, and user profiles. I'm proud of the work that has gone into making this website operational. If you'd like to see it in action or have any questions, feel free to reach out!"
